          The global economics and artistic implications of the website

          • Reflecting from the critical feedback that I have received from my
          previous commercial website; I would like to refine certain section
          using the feedback that I have received from my lecture and tutor.
          Firstly, I would like to review the design style. I would consider
          researching more about the chosen author and look at his aesthetic
          that he usually uses. Stephen King is an Author, and he released
          numerous books, checking his books I have seen that he mostly focus on
          the horror genre, through looking at his work or the website that
          people have created they mostly dwell on dark colors, however I will
          modify them, to make interactivity easier and creating friendly user
          engagement. Not only that I will comply the color rule using some
          readings which is 60-30-10. • Stephen King works lean and evoke around
          dark colors which evoke emotions of dark and suspenseful atmospheres
          as he mostly writes horror books. His colors are leaning towards
          darker, moody colors like deep blacks, grays, and muted tones. •
          "Beyond specific scenes, King's aesthetic often revolves around
          darker, earthy tones like deep reds, greens, browns, and blacks,
          enhancing the feeling of dread and suspense. These colors are used to
          evoke a sense of unease, which is crucial in his storytelling, where
          everyday settings turn into places of horror"
